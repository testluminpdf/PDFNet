/**
 * PTPDFViewCtrl is a utility class that can be used for interactive rendering of PDF documents.
 *
 * On iOS, PTPDFViewCtrl derives from UIView.
 *
 * PTPDFViewCtrl defines several coordinate spaces and it is important to understand their
 * differences:
 *
 * - Page Space refers to the space in which a PDF page is defined. It is determined by
 * a page itself and the origin is at the lower-left corner of the page. Note that Page
 * Space is independent of how a page is viewed in PDFView and each page has its own Page
 * space.
 *
 * - Canvas Space refers to the tightest axis-aligned bounding box of all the pages given
 * the current page presentation mode in PDFView. For example, if the page presentation
 * mode is e_single_continuous, all the pages are arranged vertically with one page in each
 * row, and therefore the Canvas Space is a rectangle with possibly large height value. For
 * this reason, Canvas Space is also, like Page Space, independent of the zoom factor. Also
 * note that since PDFView adds gaps between adjacent pages, the Canvas Space is larger than
 * the space occupied by all the pages. The origin of the Canvas Space is located at the
 * upper-left corner.
 *
 * - Screen Space (or Client Space) is the space occupied by PDFView and its origin is at
 * the upper-left corner. Note that the virtual size of this space can extend beyond the
 * visible region.
 *
 * - Scrollable Space is the virtual space within which PDFView can scroll. It is determined
 * by the Canvas Space and the current zoom factor. Roughly speaking, the dimensions of the
 * Scrollable Space is the dimensions of the Canvas Space timed by the zoom. Therefore, a large
 * zoom factor will result in a larger Scrollable region given the same Canvas region. For this
 * reason, Scrollable Space might also be referred to as Zoomed Canvas Space. Note that since
 * PDFView adds gaps between pages in Canvas Space and these gaps are not scaled when rendered,
 * the scrollable range is not exactly what the zoom factor times the Canvas range. For
 * functions such as `-SetHScrollPos:`, `-SetVScrollPos:`, `-GetCanvasHeight`, and
 * `-GetCanvasWidth`, it is the Scrollable Space that is involved.
 *
